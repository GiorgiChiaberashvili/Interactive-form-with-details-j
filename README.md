## My process

Never giving up and keep pushing further like before, nothing changed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Javascript
- and with bunch of Love.

### What I learned

HTML: Input has ability to limit numbers or letters by chosing (maxlength)

(Inputmode) is element for giving browsers a hint that certain element can be indicated in the input

CSS: Size of the images can be controled via (background-size) element by using % 

Javascript: Most code that I have ever written but learned tons in this project

1) number = number.replace(/\s?/g, '').replace(/(\d{4})/g, '$1 ').trim();

Removing white spaces where necessary and formatting string by inserting a space after every four digits

2) textContent represents the text inside an HTML element

3) padStart is a string method that ensures the string has a certain length by adding a specified character to the start if it's shorter.
